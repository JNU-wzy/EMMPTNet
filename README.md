# EMMPTNet

**EMMPTNet** is an explainable multi-view, multi-scale deep learning network based on physicochemical and topological properties designed to predict the binding affinity between RNA and small molecules. The model combines the chemical and structural properties of RNA and small molecules to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability.
